## CHANGES I MADE
 
- Add a person page (actor/director) with biography and movies.
- Change some styling on the movies grid, the login page and the rate component.
- Add a log out function and a sign up link.
- Get the userâ€™s movie ratings from the API.
- Add a language select and translate everything into French (including the API calls).
